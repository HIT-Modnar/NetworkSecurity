# Network Security

### Note:

The repository's content are mainly from HIT's Information Security subject's experiment. 

## Experiment 1

- [x] Implement C/S Programs

> Details:
> Write C/S programs in the Linux environment, familiar with socket programming. 
> Requires the client and server to transfer the specified file. 
> This program still needs to be used in subsequent experiments. 
> The client and server are on different machines.
>
> Note:
> I used the program named NetShell to implement the C/S two sides file transmission.

- [ ] Implement Scanner Programs with UI

> Details:
> Design the scanner with socket's connect function.
> The scanner's interface is required to input the scanned IP range and Port range, and the number of threads to be used.
> Display the result in the interface.

### P.s:

I'm not a student of the subject, so there may be many problems in the program for the experiments. 

Hope classmates could tell me how to make the program better.

Welcome classmates communicate with me!

(As you see, my English is poor... Esc-ing...)
